Using tools and intuition straight from the chemist’s toolbox, namely a technique called [Matched Molecular Pair Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matched_molecular_pair_analysis), [Tom MacDougal](/author/tom-macdougall)’s project seeks to improve the accuracy and explainability of activity predictions. By using a molecular design technique that is familiar to chemists, it is possible to appeal to the chemist’s intuition directly. Instead of having a system that instructs them what to do like robots, we hope to have one where the chemist and the predictive system can work cooperatively.
