As sequencing technologies get more precise, the definition of a cell type becomes vague and less relevant. In her work, [Assya Trofimov](/author/assya-trofimov) proposes a method to compute continuous embeddings for biological variation without the need for [hard-coded]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_coding) rules. Since cells have diverse simultaneous facets, from discrete to continuous cell types and states, approaching the construction of a cell atlas in a [data-driven manner](/publication/2020_trofimov_factorized) is key. Assyaâ€™s thesis project is about creating a human cell atlas that will help define better the concept of cell identity.
