After high school, she studied at the [Université d’Évry Val d’Essonne](https://www.univ-evry.fr/accueil.html) where, in 2018, she earned a [double BSc degree, in Computer Science and in Biology](http://formations.univ-evry.fr/fr/catalogue/licence-XA/licence-XA/informatique-J7W4814F/double-licence-sciences-de-la-vie-et-informatique-JEXZ0EBU.html). Drawn to the field of research, she started a [research master](https://admission.umontreal.ca/programmes/maitrise-en-informatique) with a specialization in artificial intelligence at the Université de Montréal in 2019. She is now working under the supervision of [Dr. Sébastien Lemieux](/author/sebastien-lemieux/) and the co-supervision of [Dr. Sylvie Mader](https://www.iric.ca/en/recherche/chercheurs-principaux/sylvie-mader) on her research project, which lies at the intersection of the fields of bioinformatics, transcriptomics, and machine learning. Learn about her project [Investigate the Role of Transcriptional Regulation in Breast Cancer Heterogeneity Using Single Cell RNA Sequencing (scRNA-seq) Data](/project/marjolaine-david-pr).
