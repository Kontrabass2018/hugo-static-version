During her master degree in Bioinformatics, **Safia Safa-tahar-henni** completed two internships: the first one at [IBPC](http://www-lbt.ibpc.fr/) where she studied flexible segment proteins docking by a multi-copy approach coupling with a robotic loop generation algorithm. The second one was at [CNAM](https://gbcm.cnam.fr/), where she worked on statistical and integrative methods to uncover a part of the missing heritability in psychiatric disorders. She is a PhD candidate in bioinformatics in [Dr. Brian Wilhelm](https://www.iric.ca/en/directory/brian-wilhelm)’s lab, co-directed by [Dr. Sébastien Lemieux](/author/sebastien-lemieux/). Safia is currently working on a 12,000 small molecule screen on different types of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) samples. Her goal is to link cells viability in response to compounds, to their expression and mutation profiles. Learn about Safia’s project [Identification of potential therapeutic targets in AML through integration of genomics data and small molecule screening results](/project/safia-safa-pr/).
