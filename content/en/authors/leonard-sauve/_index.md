Trained as a bioinformatician, **Léonard Sauvé**’s interests and studies involve using a vast repertoire of informatics tools and consolidating his biological knowledge. His first years of research during his BSc introduced him to structural biology at [Dr. Sebastian Pechmann’s laboratory](https://recherche.umontreal.ca/en/nos-chercheurs/repertoire-des-professeurs/chercheur/is/in19806/) at the [Université de Montréal](https://www.umontreal.ca/en/). During the two summer internships at this lab, he studied structural motifs driving chaperone interactions in yeast. He then got introduced to developmental biology at the Montréal clinical research institute ([IRCM](https://ircm.qc.ca/en)) with [Dr. Marie Kmita](https://ircm.qc.ca/en/research/neurobiology-and-development/genetics-and-development), where he was trained to perform chromatin markers and RNA expression analyses from high-throughput sequencing data in mice. Finishing his undergraduate studies, the university awarded him a PhD studentship, which led him to [Dr. Sebastien Lemieux](/author/sebastien-lemieux/)’s lab at the Institute for research in immunology and cancer [IRIC](https://www.iric.ca/en) in 2018. At IRIC, he works on developing machine learning approaches to evaluate the risk of human acute myeloid leukemia ([AML](https://www.cancer.ca/en/cancer-information/cancer-type/leukemia-acute-myelogenous-aml/acute-myelogenous-leukemia/?region=on)) from gene expression data. Past scientific collaborations with lab members at IRIC were showcased in the 2019 and 2020 ISMB conferences.
