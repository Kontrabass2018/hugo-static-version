Before starting her undergraduate degree, **Assya Trofimov** secured an internship at [IRIC](https://www.iric.ca/en) with [Dr. Claude Perreault]((https://www.iric.ca/fr/recherche/chercheurs-principaux/claude-perreault)), studying the adaptive immune system. Upon completion of her degree, she chose to change towards a [Masters in Bioinformatics](https://diro.umontreal.ca/english/programs/graduate-programs/masters-in-bioinformatics/) and then a [PhD in Computer Science](https://admission.umontreal.ca/en/programs/phd-in-computer-science/), co-directed by both Drs. Claude Perreault and [Sébastien Lemieux](/author/sebastien-lemieux/). 

Her current ambition is to develop deep learning models of the adaptive immune system. Learn about her project [The factorized embeddings model: Towards a data-driven cell atlas](/project/assya-trofimov-pr).
