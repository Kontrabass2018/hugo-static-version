Trained as a microbiologist, **Sébastien Lemieux** turned to bioinformatics in 1997 and completed his Master’s and Ph.D. studies at the [Université de Montréal](https://www.umontreal.ca/en/) under the direction of [François Major](https://www.iric.ca/en/research/principal-investigators/francois-major). After obtaining his Ph.D. in 2002, the young Investigator headed to the private sector to carry out postdoctoral training at Elitra Canada (now [Merck & Co](https://www.merck.com/)) under the supervision of Bo Jiang. There he acquired skills in sequence analysis and the analysis of DNA microarray data, as well as in computer integration of experimental data.

He finally joined the [IRIC](https://www.iric.ca/en)’s ranks in 2005. In 2018, he was appointed Associate Professor in the [Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Medicine](https://biochimie.umontreal.ca/en/) of the [Faculty of Medicine](https://medecine.umontreal.ca/medical-school/) of the Université de Montréal.
