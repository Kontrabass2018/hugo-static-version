#**Nicolas Jacquin** arrived in Canada in August 2019 to study bio-informatics at the Université de Montréal as a [BSc student](https://admission.umontreal.ca/programmes/baccalaureat-en-bioinformatique/). He secured an internship during his first year of studying at the CHUM, with [Dr. Gregor Andelfinger](https://www.andelfingerlab.com/) where he became familiar with the single cell sequencing bio-informatics pipelines. As he continued to study, Nicolas secured another internship during the [Sébastien Lemieux](/author/sebastien-lemieux/) where he currently works on neural-network-derived embeddings for predicting phenotype.
