**Caroline Labelle** first experimented with bioinformatics during an internship at [IRIC](https://www.iric.ca/en) under the supervision of [Dr. Sébastien Lemieux](/author/sebastien-lemieux/) during which she developed [myCircos](http://mycircos.iric.ca/), a web-based tool for data visualization. Following this internship, Caroline undertook graduate studies aimed at developing methodologies for the analysis of cellular responses to chemical compounds, under the supervision of both Drs. Sébastien Lemieux and [Anne Marinier](https://www.iric.ca/en/repertoire/anne-marinier). Learn about Caroline’s project [Enhancing the Drug Discovery Process: using Bayesian inference for the analysis of dose-response experiments](/project/caroline-labelle-pr).

Caroline is committed to the promotion of science and the place of women in it. She is a teaching assistant for various courses in the [BSc in Bioinformatics](https://admission.umontreal.ca/programmes/baccalaureat-en-bio-informatique/), as well as being involved in the [AÉBINUM](http://www.aebinum.umontreal.ca/index_EN.html) and a volunteer for the Projet [SEUR](http://seur.qc.ca/).
