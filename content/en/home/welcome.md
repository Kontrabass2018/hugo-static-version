# Original text
#The Lemieux's lab’s main focus of research is the analysis of -omics data, coming from high-throughput sequencing and screening experimentents. We aim to utilise this data to gain insight on human cancer by developing machine-learning approaches as well as using state-of-the-art tools. We work on creating and developing pipelines that can challenge old and sometimes outdated bioinformatics methods. We perform both fundamental and translational research, in that we try to contribute to the scientific advancements in bioinformatics as well as using them to the benefit of improving cancer treatment. Our team is truly multidisciplinary, uniting students of various backgrounds; biologists, bioinformaticians and computer scientists alike, all find a place here. The type of data we analyse is equally diverse; transcriptomics, chemo-genomics, proteomics, all are rich and contribute to our work.

**Bioinformatics & Cancer Research**

Our lab is affiliated to the Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer ([IRIC](https://www.iric.ca/en)) at the Université de Montréal ([UdeM](https://www.umontreal.ca/en/)). Our multidisciplinary team **develops bioinformatics tools** and **analysis pipelines**, and leverages **machine learning** and other **computational approaches** to analyze [**omics**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4615774/) data such as **transcriptomic**, **chemogenomic**, and **proteomic data**. Through fundamental, translational and clinical research, we help improve **cancer** treatment.
